     *  PERFORM A ONE-HOUR AND ONE-DAY TWAP

     *  This contract includes four functions that are called at different intervals: the first two functions are 1 hour apart,
     *  while the last two are 1 day apart.
     *
     *  The challenge is to calculate the one-hour and one-day TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price) of the first token in the
     *  given pool and store the results in the return variable.
     *
     *  Hint: For each time interval, the player needs to take a snapshot in the first function, then calculate the TWAP
     *  in the second function and divide it by the appropriate time interval.
